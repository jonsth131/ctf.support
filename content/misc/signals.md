## Identifying signals
To identify unknown signals, [SigidWiki](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide) is a good starting point.

## Decoding Signals
There are several tools available to decode signals, some of them are listed below.

- [fldigi](https://www.w1hkj.org/), a software suite for amateur radio.
- [DigiPan](https://bpsk31.com/apps/) is a free program to decode PSk31/PSK63 signals.

## SSTV 
Slow Scan TV is used to send images over radio signals.

Using a tool like [qsstv](https://github.com/ON4QZ/QSSTV) for Linux or [RX-SSTV](https://users.belgacom.net/hamradio/rxsstv.htm) for Windows, the signals can be decoded.

## Morse signals
To decode morse signals, this [decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) can be used.

## DTMF tones
To decode DTMF tones, the following tools can be used.

- [dtmf-decoder](https://github.com/ribt/dtmf-decoder), Python cli tool to decode DTMF tones.
- [Detect DTMF Tones](http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html), online decoder.
