## Identifying signals
To identify unknown signals, [SigidWiki](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide) is a good starting point.

## SSTV 
Slow Scan TV is used to send images over radio signals.

Using a tool like [qsstv](https://github.com/ON4QZ/QSSTV) for Linux or [RX-SSTV](https://users.belgacom.net/hamradio/rxsstv.htm) for Windows, the signals can be decoded.
