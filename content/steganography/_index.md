## Introduction

**Steganography** is the practice of **hiding data inside ordinary files**, such as images, audio recordings, or text.
Unlike encryption, which hides *meaning*, steganography hides the *existence* of data.

In CTF challenges, steganography often conceals **flags**, **keys**, or **next‑stage clues** within visually or audibly normal files.

Common forms include:

- Adjusting the **least significant bits (LSB)** in image or audio data
- Encoding data in **spectrograms** or **metadata fields**
- Using **zero‑width Unicode characters** or **spacing** in text
