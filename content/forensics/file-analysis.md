## File identification
To identify the type of a file, the command `file` can be used.
Identifying multiple types of a single file, in case of polyglots, `file -k/--keep-going` can be used.

## Metadata
To extract metadata from various file types, `exiftool` can be used.

## Extracting data
To extract files from binary data, `binwalk` or `foremost` can be used.
