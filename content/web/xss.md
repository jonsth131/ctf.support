---

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can be used to steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.

Types of XSS:

- **Reflected XSS**: The payload is reflected off the web server, such as in search results or error messages.
- **Stored XSS**: The payload is stored on the server, such as in a comment or forum post.
- **DOM-based XSS**: The payload is executed by modifying the DOM in the victim's browser.
