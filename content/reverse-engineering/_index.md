## Introduction

Reverse Engineering (RE) is the process of analyzing compiled executables or binaries to understand their inner logic, recover data, or find hidden functionality.
In CTF challenges, RE allows you to recover passwords, keys, or validation routines from compiled programs.

Common RE tasks include:

- Disassembling machine code
- Decompiling bytecode or binaries
- Debugging and tracing runtime behavior
- Patching executables or bypassing protections
